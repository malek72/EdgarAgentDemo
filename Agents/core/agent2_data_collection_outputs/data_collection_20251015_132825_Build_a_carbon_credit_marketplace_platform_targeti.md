## Idea Being Researched

**Idea**: Build a carbon credit marketplace platform targeting APAC region or specific verticals

**Category**: business_opportunity

**Market Sector**: Carbon Markets / Climate Tech / FinTech

**Feasibility Score**: 8/10. Strong feasibility based on: (1) Validated massive market growth trajectory with multiple independent projections showing 15-32% CAGR[1][5]. (2) Clear technology enablement through blockchain, AI, and API infrastructure lowering barriers to entry[1][5]. (3) Strong regulatory tailwinds including EU ETS expansion, CORSIA aviation scheme, and potential CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism)[2][5]. (4) Proven demand from corporate net-zero commitments and ESG mandates[5]. (5) Geographic whitespace in APAC region with fastest growth rates[9]. Main risks: (1) Market faces transparency and universal standards challenges[2][5]. (2) Voluntary carbon markets experiencing validation concerns requiring robust verification systems[9]. (3) Competitive landscape includes well-funded players. (4) Regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions. The $500M opportunity estimate appears conservative given market projections; a well-executed APAC-focused platform could capture significantly more value.
