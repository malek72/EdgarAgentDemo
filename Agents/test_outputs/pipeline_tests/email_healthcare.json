The apps don't integrate with insurance \nor share data with doctors automatically.\n\nThis is 2024! Why isn't this solved?\n\nMy research shows 37M Americans have diabetes, most are over 50 (not tech-savvy).\nMedicare covers monitoring devices but they're all 20 years behind on UX.\n\nSomeone needs to build the \"Apple Watch for chronic disease management\" \nthat actually works with insurance billing. This could be a $5B+ opportunity.\n\nThoughts?\n- Mike\n        "
