## 8. RISK ASSESSMENT

### Market Risks

- **Growth rate volatility:** Market projections 18–22% CAGR, but subject to economic and regulatory cycles.
- **Customer concentration:** Top client is 19% of revenue; risk if contract lost.

### Competitive Risks

- **Incumbent scale:** Bowery/Plenty have larger war chests; risk if UrbanFarm tech gap narrows.
- **Tech replication:** Robots/automation may become commodity, eroding moats.

### Execution Risks

- **Deployment delays:** Urban facility buildouts subject to construction, zoning, and regulatory hurdles.
- **Scaling hardware:** Ensuring reliability of robotics and sensor stack under rapid expansion.

### Financial Risks

- **Capital intensity:** Significant cash needed for deployments; recent $5M mitigates short-term risk.
- **Supply chain vulnerabilities:** Hardware/manufacturing partner dependency.

### Regulatory Risks

- **Zoning/building codes:** Urban farming must meet strict city requirements.
- **Food safety:** Evolving robot/facility standards, especially for automated handling.

### Technology Risks

- **Platform reliability:** Failures impact yield, customer outcomes; mitigated by ongoing R&D and engineering hires.
- **Technology obsolescence:** Rapid sector innovation; necessary to maintain technical edge.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Diversified client base:** Expanding distribution, retailer, and consumer contracts.
- **Robust R&D:** Ongoing platform upgrades and IP filings.
- **Vendor redundancy:** Multiple manufacturing partnerships in place.
- **Strong balance sheet:** $2.1M cash, no debt, controlled burn.
- **Insurance/contractual hedges:** UrbanFarm includes disruption, compliance risk management.

### Risk-adjusted Returns

- After accounting for execution, competition, and regulatory risks, base case IRR remains attractive (20–35% estimated over 3 years), downside covered by asset/IP value.
