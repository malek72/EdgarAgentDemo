          "market_viability": "The global AI customer support tools market is projected to grow from $12.06 billion in 2024 to $47.82 billion by 2030 at a 25.8% CAGR, with rapid adoption across industries like retail, healthcare, and finance. 95% of customer interactions expected to be AI-powered by 2025 shows strong demand. Key advancements in generative AI and speech recognition bolster feasibility. Incumbents have struggled to deliver fully autonomous, seamless solutions.",
          "recent_developments": "Major industry reports highlight autonomous AI agents as transformative in customer service[1][3][4][5]. Retail chatbot spending alone is set to grow from $12B in 2023 to $72B in 2028[5]. Vendors are prioritizing generative AI and omnichannel deployment, but few have achieved full autonomy. New startups and open-source projects (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT) are rapidly advancing the infrastructure for such agents.",
          "key_metrics": "Global market value $13B (2024), $83.85B (2033)[1]; Customer support tools $47.82B (2030)[3][5]; 95% of interactions AI-powered by 2025[5][9]; ROI up to 8x for leading companies[5].",
          "competitors": "Zendesk, Intercom (incumbents); Freshdesk, Salesforce Service Cloud; emerging players leveraging GPT/LLM infrastructure (e.g., Cognigy, Ada, Ultimate.ai, Forethought, OpenAI powered integrations). Most current competitors offer semi-automated or hybrid solutions, not true end-to-end autonomy.",
          "feasibility_score": "9 - Market demand is immense, incumbent solutions are lagging, technical infrastructure is maturing, and significant venture capital is flowing into AI agent startups. The main risks are reliability, data privacy, and complex use-case coverage, but progress is accelerating rapidly."
