    "text": "\nSubject: Potential Investment Opportunity - AI Tutoring Platform\n\nHi Team,\n\nI wanted to share an interesting opportunity I came across. There's a growing market \nfor AI-powered tutoring platforms, especially in STEM subjects. Companies like Khan \nAcademy and Duolingo are seeing massive growth, but there's still a gap in personalized \n1-on-1 AI tutoring for high school and college students.\n\nThe edtech market is projected to reach $404B by 2025, with AI tutoring being one of \nthe fastest-growing segments (32% CAGR). I think we should explore building or \ninvesting in this space.\n\nKey points:\n- Market size: $10B+ in US alone for tutoring services\n- Growing demand post-pandemic for online learning\n- AI advancements (GPT-4, Claude) make personalized tutoring scalable\n- Subscription model could generate $30-50/month per student\n\nWhat do you think? Should we schedule a deeper dive?\n\nBest,\nSarah\n        "
