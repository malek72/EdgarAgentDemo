          "market_viability": "High. The construction management software market is growing rapidly, expected to reach $17.9 billion by 2035 at a CAGR of 9.1%. There is strong demand for modern, mobile-accessible, cloud-based solutions, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises. The need for user-friendly platforms compatible with field work is particularly acute in the SMB segment.",
          "recent_developments": "Recent reports emphasize rapid digitalization in construction management, with cloud-based and mobile-first platforms becoming industry standards. Mobile apps that allow real-time reporting, scheduling, and communication are seen as valuable for field teams, with the majority of new deployments being cloud/SaaS and mobile-integrated.[5][3]",
          "key_metrics": "Global construction and design software market: $10.96B (2024), projected $11.67B (2025), $19.1B (2030), CAGR 10.4% (2025-2030)[3]. Construction management software specifically: $7.5B (2025), $17.9B (2035), CAGR 9.1%[5]. Mobile-focused platforms and the cloud deployment sector are expected to make up over 61.3% of market share by 2025.[5]",
          "competitors": "Major vendors include Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud, Buildertrend, PlanGrid, and CoConstruct. While these solutions exist, many SMBs remain underserved, often due to high costs, complexity, or lack of truly mobile-native apps. The opportunity lies in developing a lower-cost, intuitive solution specifically tuned for small contractors and easy mobile adoption.[4][5]",
          "feasibility_score": 8,
          "explanation": "The market is well-established, rapidly growing, and demonstrates a clear demand (especially from SMBs) for improved, mobile-centric solutions. Existing competitors are significant but focused mostly on large enterprises or offer complex, costly products. A targeted, affordable, user-friendly, and mobile-first approach addresses a validated pain point and market gap."
