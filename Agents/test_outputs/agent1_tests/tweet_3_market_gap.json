          "market_viability": "Validated by rapid growth and projections for the global data visualization market, with sizes cited between $8B and $25B in 2025, and strong CAGR (over 9%). Demand is increasing for cloud-based, collaborative, and user-friendly BI tools that offer low-code/no-code experiences and seamless integration with other business tools. Gaps exist due to dissatisfaction with legacy players (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI), often termed as bloatware or locked-in ecosystems.",
          "recent_developments": "Significant venture investment as noted (Mode: $200M, Hex: $52M) shows strong appetite for new entrants. Larger market activity includes M&A (e.g., Looker acquired by Google), innovation in low-code solutions (Domo launching low-code app builder in 2024), and expansion by other players like MapmyIndia into AI-driven analytics. The sector is defined by surging cloud adoption and demand for real-time, user-friendly analytics tools.[4][8]",
          "key_metrics": "Market size projections for data visualization tools range from $8.2 billion in 2024 to $25.77 billion by 2034, with growth rates between 7.38% and 11.2% CAGR.[4][5][6][8] Mode.com ($200M raised) and hex.tech ($52M raised) reflect active investor support. North America and Asia Pacific are identified as high-growth regions.[3][4][6]",
          "competitors": "Major incumbents include Tableau (Salesforce), PowerBI (Microsoft), Qlik, SAP, and niche or next-gen players like Mode, Hex, Domo, and MapmyIndia's ClarityX. Differentiation opportunity exists for a Figma-like, collaborative, design-centric, and web-first experience.[4][5][8]",
          "feasibility_score": "9 - The combination of clear market dissatisfaction with incumbents, robust market growth, and very recent fundraising rounds for 'next-gen' players underscores high feasibility, though the field is competitive and requires a differentiated product experience."
