They're saying it takes 4-6 weeks and requires hiring \nexternal consultants.\n\nThis is costing them $50K-100K per migration and it's becoming a major \nfriction point in our sales process. Three deals fell through last quarter \nspecifically because of migration concerns.\n\nMaybe there's an opportunity here to build an automated migration tool or \nservice? I know companies like Segment and Fivetran have built entire \nbusinesses around data integration.\n\nJust a thought - wanted to flag this pattern.\n\n- Marcus\n        "
