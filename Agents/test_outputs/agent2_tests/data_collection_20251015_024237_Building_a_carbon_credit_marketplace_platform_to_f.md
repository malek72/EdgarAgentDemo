**Key Information**: Karbon-X Corp ("Karbon-X" or "the Company") is a public Nevada corporation that offers investors exposure to certified carbon credits which are a key component of evolving global strategies to tackle climate change and reduce carbon emissions.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION: "Karbon-X is a carbon credit management company focused on supporting businesses and individuals in achieving carbon neutrality. The company aggregates, verifies, and facilitates transactions of certified carbon credits on behalf of its clients by leveraging a proprietary digital platform. Karbon-X works with project developers, certifiers, and market participants globally to source, validate, and monitor carbon reduction projects. The Company aims to deregulate access to carbon offsetting, democratize impact investing, and provide transparency to the voluntary carbon markets."

MD&A DISCUSSION (full excerpt):

"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: 2024 was a pivotal year for Karbon-X Corp. With an increased focus on sustainability, climate policy, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing, demand for carbon credits continued to accelerate globally. The Karbon-X platform saw increased onboarding of project developers and institutional buyers, especially in North America and Europe. Our primary sources of revenue remain transaction fees from carbon credit sales, subscription fees for our management platform, and consulting services related to project certification. Operating expenses included significant investments in product development and regulatory compliance infrastructure, particularly in light of new rules from the SEC and European agencies requiring more robust disclosures regarding climate-related activities."

"Risk Factors: Fluctuations in carbon credit prices, adverse regulatory changes, market acceptance of voluntary carbon credits, reliance on third-party certification agencies, risk of project non-performance or fraud, cybersecurity risks related to our platform, competition from larger exchanges or new entrants, ongoing need for technology investment, and potential reputational risk if controversies emerge about specific credits."

"Forward-Looking Statements: Our goal for 2025 is to expand cross-border trading capabilities, deepen partnership with institutional buyers, and launch an enterprise API for integrating carbon credit procurement directly into enterprise procurement workflows. We continue to monitor evolving compliance and disclosure rules in both the United States and the European Union."
