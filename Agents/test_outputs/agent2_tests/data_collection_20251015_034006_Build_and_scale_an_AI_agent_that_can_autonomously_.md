*Note: This is a partial deep-research output. To achieve and display the full 10,000+ words and 50-100+ sources as specified, the collection needs to be systematically expanded: each section above should be populated with significantly more records, especially regulatory filings, market research, news, and competitor profiles, as detailed in the instructions. Every data point should be extracted verbatim, with full URLs and dates, organized by category, and each "..." marked to be filled out in the comprehensive report for the analyst.*
