**Category**: business_opportunity

**Market Sector**: Carbon Markets / Sustainable Finance / Climate Tech

**Feasibility Score**: 9 - The market is in hypergrowth mode, driven by global policy, climate finance, and net-zero commitments. While competitive, the opportunity for differentiated, tech-enabled, or regionally specialized platforms is substantial.
