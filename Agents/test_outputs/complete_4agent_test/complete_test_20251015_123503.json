Thoughts?\n\nBest,\nSarah\n    ",

The company enables voluntary carbon credit transactions, emission registry services, and related sustainability finance solutions. As of the date of this prospectus, ACX has processed transactions representing over 50 million metric tonnes of CO2e since inception in 2019. ACX\u2019s mission is to accelerate the adoption of transparent, standardized carbon markets through blockchain-based infrastructure and API connectivity. Generating revenue fees for market access, trades, registry linkages, and certification, ACX targets project developers, corporations seeking offsets, intermediaries, and financial market participants as customers.\\n\\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, ACX generated revenues of $6.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 67.6%. Operating expenses rose from $2.1 million in 2021 to $3.9 million in 2022 driven by increased technology investment, regulatory compliance, and personnel costs. Net income in 2022 totaled $1.22 million, with gross margin expanding to 64.7% from 59.4% in 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 totaled $5.3 million, with no long-term debt outstanding.\\n\\nPLATFORM GROWTH\\nUser accounts increased from 102 institutional members as of December 2021 to 196 by December 2022. Total traded carbon credits rose from 14.9 million tCO2e to 39.2 million tCO2e over the same period. ACX launched API-based connectivity for registry and trading integration in Q4 2022, contributing to 23% of all trades for Q1 2023.\\n\\nRISK FACTORS\\n- Volatility in carbon credit pricing may impact volume and revenue generation.\\n- Regulatory uncertainty regarding voluntary and compliance market regimes may affect business operations.\\n- Reliance on third-party registries for project credit verification creates operational and reputational risk.\\n- Competition from established exchanges (CME, Xpansiv, CIX, Nasdaq) and technology-driven entrants may impact market share.\\n- Cybersecurity threats targeting API and blockchain infrastructure pose material risks.\\n- Changes in environmental policy or climate regulation could impact trading demand or requirements.\\n\\nSEGMENT DATA\\nACX operates a single reporting segment: digital environmental credits exchange services.
