**Current**: 8-12 seconds per extraction  
**Target**: 5-7 seconds for production  
**Optimization**: Consider caching or model parameter tuning

### 3. Idea Deduplication
**Issue**: Similar ideas across different inputs not detected  
**Impact**: Medium - May create duplicate work downstream  
**Recommendation**: Add similarity detection between extractions

### 4. Confidence Calibration
**Current**: All 15 tests returned "high" confidence  
**Impact**: Low - But may need more granular confidence scoring  
**Recommendation**: Implement numerical confidence (0-100) for better filtering
